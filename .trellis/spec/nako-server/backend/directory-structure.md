# Directory Structure

`nako-server` is the composition, app orchestration, runtime-supervision, and
HTTP boundary crate. Keep handlers thin and put business workflow in focused app
services.

## Current Layout

```text
crates/nako-server/src/
├── main.rs                # binary entrypoint
├── config.rs              # server config and preflight
├── app.rs                 # NakoApp root and app module exports
├── app/                   # orchestration services and runtime helpers
├── http.rs                # router assembly and auth layering
├── http/                  # Axum route modules and HTTP mapping
├── api_mapping.rs         # domain/API conversion helpers
├── playback_mapping.rs    # playback-specific API conversion helpers
└── *_tests/ or tests/     # app and HTTP test modules
```

## Module Rules

- Put HTTP route handlers under `src/http/<area>.rs`.
- Put workflow logic under `src/app/<area>.rs` or a focused submodule such as
  `src/app/playback/*`.
- Keep HTTP handlers as request/response translators. They should call app
  services instead of directly coordinating database, storage, and runtime work.
- Keep runtime supervisors and durable job orchestration in `src/app/*runtime*`
  modules, not in individual route handlers.
- Keep config parsing and operator preflight in `config.rs` and
  `config/preflight.rs`.
- Put route tests under `src/http/tests/` and app-service tests under
  `src/app/tests/`.

## Control-Plane Boundary

- Durable jobs, runtime supervision, diagnostics, addon mediation, remote
  access, and API scale contracts are shared control-plane behavior. Check ADR
  0053 before adding hidden per-feature helpers.
- Long-running scan, metadata, playback, addon, webhook, or artifact workflows
  must use durable job/runtime boundaries instead of raw `tokio::spawn`.
- Resource admission belongs in app runtime helpers such as
  `app/playback/resource.rs`, not in pure planner crates.

## Examples

- `http.rs`: central router assembly, auth, network boundary, and API version
  header.
- `http/admin.rs`: Admin route grouping with admin principal enforcement.
- `app/job_runtime.rs`: durable job lease/heartbeat/cancellation boundary.
- `app/playback/resource.rs`: playback runtime resource admission.
- `app/metadata.rs` and `app/metadata_application.rs`: app services wrapping
  metadata workflows.

## Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong

```rust
async fn route_handler(State(app): State<NakoApp>) -> ApiResult<Json<Response>> {
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        // long-running metadata apply work
    });
    Ok(Json(Response::default()))
}
```

### Correct

```rust
async fn route_handler(State(app): State<NakoApp>) -> ApiResult<Json<Response>> {
    let summary = app.metadata_service().apply_review(request).await?;
    Ok(Json(map_summary(summary)))
}
```

Handlers translate and delegate. Durable work goes through the app runtime
boundary.
