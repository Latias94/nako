# Workstreams

Workstreams group related milestones, TODOs, phase notes, and design context.
They are not ownership silos; they are long-running areas of architectural
attention.

## Current Workstreams

- [storage-vfs](storage-vfs/README.md): active M6 remote storage, VFS cache,
  remote staging, and WebDAV preview work.
- [addons-automation](addons-automation/README.md): completed M5 webhook,
  automation, addon manifest, provider, and trust-boundary work.
- [server-foundation](server-foundation/README.md): completed backend
  foundation, catalog, metadata, playback, transcode, VFS, and historical
  planning hub.

## When To Split A Workstream

Split a workstream when one of these becomes true:

- it has independent milestones that can progress without blocking the active
  backend foundation;
- it needs its own ADR cluster or validation matrix;
- its TODO file becomes too broad to guide the next implementation goal;
- the same docs are repeatedly edited for unrelated domains.

Expected future splits:

- `playback-streaming`
- `metadata-catalog`
- `clients`

Keep unsplit domains in `server-foundation` until a split reduces real
coordination cost. Avoid splitting merely because a domain exists conceptually.

## Standard Files

A substantial workstream should have:

- `README.md`: purpose, status, goals, non-goals, links to active phases.
- `MILESTONES.md`: ordered outcomes with deliverables and exit criteria.
- `TODO.md`: task-level checklist grouped by subsystem.
- `PHASE*.md`: phase-specific design and validation notes when needed.
